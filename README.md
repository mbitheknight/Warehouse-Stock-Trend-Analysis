# Project Title: Warehouse Stock Trend Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project, I focused on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing warehouse data to uncover insights regarding stock levels, supplier dependencies, warehouse utilization, and stock-sales relationships. The goal is to assist stakeholders in optimizing inventory management and supplier relationships for efficient operations across multiple warehouses.

## Business Problem
The company aims to enhance its inventory management strategy across different product categories and warehouses. The project focuses on analyzing stock levels, supplier contributions, and sales to provide actionable recommendations that improve operational efficiency and minimize risks associated with inventory shortages or overstocking.

## The Data
The dataset used in this project includes warehouse management data with columns representing product categories, quantities, sales, suppliers, and warehouse locations. The dataset was obtained from the company's internal database.
### Data Folder Structure
- `data/warehouse_management_data.csv`

## Key Points
- I addressed missing values, ensured proper data types, and handled inconsistencies in the dataset to prepare it for analysis.
- The final recommendations are based on insights derived from analyzing stock trends, supplier dependency, and warehouse utilization.
- This project aims to communicate findings effectively to stakeholders, particularly inventory managers and supply chain executives.

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning
- Identified and handled missing values appropriately to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.
- Standardized categorical data (e.g., supplier names, product categories) and transformed numerical columns for proper analysis.
  
### Data Analysis
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to calculate stock levels, sales figures, and supplier contributions.
- Aggregated data by category, warehouse, and supplier to identify key trends and patterns.

### Data Visualization
- I used Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook for visualizing insights into stock levels, supplier contributions, warehouse utilization, and the relationship between stock and sales.
- I also used Tableau to create interactive dashboards, offering stakeholders a dynamic and user-friendly way to explore the data.

## Recommendations
**Recommendation 1**: Based on stock level analysis, consider adjusting stock quantities for categories that frequently experience fluctuations (e.g., Electronics and Clothing). This can help maintain optimal stock levels.

**Recommendation 2**: Diversify supplier relationships to reduce the risk of over-reliance on a few suppliers, particularly for high-demand categories.

**Recommendation 3**: Optimize warehouse utilization by redistributing stock to under-utilized warehouses, ensuring more efficient use of space and reducing overstock risks in other locations.

**Recommendation 4**: Use insights from the stock-sales correlation to improve inventory restocking strategies, ensuring that high-demand products do not run out of stock.

## Conclusion
By analyzing stock levels, supplier dependency, and warehouse utilization, I have identified key areas for improvement in inventory management. My findings will assist the company in making data-driven decisions that optimize stock levels, mitigate risks associated with supplier reliance, and enhance the overall efficiency of the warehouse operations.
